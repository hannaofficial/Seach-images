This a website where you can search bautiful image
I use Unspash ApI for getting The Image . In this website I also integrate Dark and Light Theme

Here I  use useQuery hook because of that If anyone search the same url it automatically get loaded without being loaded from the api call 

useQuery code is in Gallery.jsx

If you want to run this code on your computer

You use have to get Unsplash API from there website
and
Write NPM INSTALL followed by NPM RUN DEV in your terminal
